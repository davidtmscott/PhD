# PhD projects code

Some code from my two main project carried out thus far as part of my PhD

## Project 1 

Developed a metric using mean first passage time of a random walker to assess how invasible a landscape is. That is, how long will it take a random walker, starting at a source site, to traverse a network of patches and reach target patch for the first time. 

I then compare this metric against a previously established metric known as Condatis. Condatis is based off an electirical circuit analogy.

This is developed to be used by conservationsist who need accurate and efficient metrics to "score" many thousands of alternative habitat network configurations. 

I used four algorithms to create a wide range of theoretical landscapes configurations so that our results would be robust against empirical networks.
